## Overview

### Data Source 
The data is sourced from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Consumer Complaint Database. This publicly available dataset captures complaints submitted by consumers about financial products and services in the United States.

The database includes complaints related to products such as credit cards, mortgages, bank accounts, loans, and payment services. Each record represents an individual complaint and contains structured information, including: 

• Product and sub-product <br>
• Issue and sub-issue <br>
• Date the complaint was received and forwarded to the company <br>
• Company name <br>
• Consumer location (state) <br>
• Company response and resolution status <br>
• Timeliness of the company’s response <br>

Complaints are submitted directly by consumers and third parties, reviewed by the CFPB for completeness, and then published for transparency and public analysis. While the data reflects reported consumer experiences rather than verified regulatory findings, it is widely used for monitoring consumer risk, identifying systemic issues, and evaluating company responsiveness.
